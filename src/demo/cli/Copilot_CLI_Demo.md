# GitHub Copilot CLI Demo
## Introduction
This demo focuses on the use cases for the GitHub Copilot CLI, which allows you to use GitHub Copilot from your terminal, keeping you in your flow state during those terminal specific tasks.  The GitHub Copilot CLI is now part of the Copilot for Business collection of products (as announced at GitHub Universe 2023).  

You can find out more information about GitHub Copilot CLI here : [About GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli/about-github-copilot-in-the-cli)

Information on enabling GitHub Copilot CLI is available here : [Enabling GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli/enabling-github-copilot-in-the-cli).  Note that this feature is enabled for your MTC EXP Developer Persona, which is the same persona used for the other GitHub Copilot EXP demos.

## How Does GitHub Copilot CLI Help Me?
Unlike the Copilot in your IDE, Copilot in the CLI can help you in the following areas.

- **Terminal Commands** - Copilot can help you with terminal commands, such as `ls`, `cd`, and `mkdir`
- **Git Commands** - Copilot can help you with git commands, such as `git init`, `git clone`, and `git add`
- **Github CLI Commands** - Copilot can help you with GitHub CLI commands, such as `gh auth`, `gh repo`, and `gh pr`

## Examples
Like many of the copilot demos, understanding how to demo copilots requires spending time interacting them.  In addition to the guidance in the [Using GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli/using-github-copilot-in-the-cli) documentation, here are some examples of how I like to use GitHub Copilot CLI.
